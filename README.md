## Simple Application demonstrating Passwordless authentication and subsequent Social Connection Upgrade

So you basically:

```
1) start with passwordless,
2) when the user is ready to create their dropbox account, they opt to "sign up" by selecting "Link Dropbox"
3) an easy extension point would to have the application be configurable to receive further `upgrade` connection types,
 for instance linking to an Enterprise connection.
```

### Prerequisites

In order to run this example you will need to have Java 8 and Maven installed. You can install Maven with [brew](http://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install maven
```

Check that your maven version is 3.0.x or above:
```sh
mvn -v
```

### Setup

Create an [Auth0 Account](https://auth0.com) (if not already done so - free!).


#### From the Auth0 Dashboard

Create an application - for the purposes of this sample - `app`

Ensure you add the following to the settings.

Allowed Callback URLs:

```
http://localhost:3099/callback
```

Ensure you add the following to the settings.

Allowed Logout URLs:

```
http://localhost:3099/logout
```

Now, please ensure you set up both a

```
Passwordless SMS Connection (Connections -> Passwordless -> SMS)
Dropbox Social Connection (Connections -> Social -> Dropbox)
```

Both of these connection types NEED to be associated with the application you have created - `app`

That's it for the Dashboard setup!


### Update configuration information

Enter your:

`client_id`, `client_secret`, and `domain` information into `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml`


### Build and Run

In order to build and run the project you must execute:
```sh
mvn clean install tomcat7:run
```

Then, go to [http://localhost:3099/login](http://localhost:3099/login).
